# PlantCRE

Welcome to the official repository for the paper **"Precise Engineering of Gene Expression by Editing Plasticity"**.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used in our research on precise engineering of gene expression by editing plasticity. Our work includes the development and application of two model frameworks, Basenji2-3K and Basenji2-long, to study gene expression across various plant species.

## Repository Contents

- **Basenji2-3K.py**: Python implementation of the Basenji2-3K model framework.
- **Basenji2-long.py**: Python implementation of the Basenji2-long model framework.
- **TPMS/**: Directory containing TPM (Transcripts Per Million) files for four different plant species after processing.
- **Trained_models/**: Directory containing the trained models for the respective frameworks.
