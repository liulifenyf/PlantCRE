# PlantCRE: Identification of Plant Cis-Regulatory Elements Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the official repository for the paper **"Precise Engineering of Gene Expression by Editing Plasticity"**. This repository contains the code, data, and trained models used in our research on the precise engineering of gene expression by editing plasticity. Our work includes the development and application of two model frameworks, **Basenji2-3K** and **Basenji2-long**, to study gene expression across various plant species.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents  

- **`Basenji2-3K.py`**: Python implementation of the Basenji2-3K model framework.  
- **`Basenji2-long.py`**: Python implementation of the Basenji2-long model framework.  
- **`TPMs_for_4_species/`**: Directory containing TPM (Transcripts Per Million) files for four different plant species after processing.  
- **`Trained_models/`**: Directory containing the trained models for the respective frameworks.
